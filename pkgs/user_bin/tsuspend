# Description: A rather unsophisticated little script that I wrote for
#    myself. Since I usually fall asleep listening to gnaural or watching
#    a movie on my computer beside my bed, I wanted something to suspend
#    my computer rather than using shutdown.
#
# Usage : sudo ./sleeptimer <integer>
#    where <integer> is the number of minutes before the computer is suspended
#
