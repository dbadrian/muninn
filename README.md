# muninn

Muninn is a small personal project to maintain, backup, synchronize dotfiles and other config files for my projects, tools (e.g., sublime, zsh), or backup-solutions.
It is not meant to be a general tool for everyone. Inspired by many other such projects. Just for fun and hopefully I can learn something.

Is this safe to use? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (read: hell no)
Why? Cause I didn't make it safe to run yet....and inherently by design of the "build system" (imagine something macgyver built under influence) user mistakes can become very vicious.
Be happy you will never get to see the cluster...mess of this when it was just bash scripts :).
